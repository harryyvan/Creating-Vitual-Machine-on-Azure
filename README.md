<h1>Azure Vitual Machine</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/DWXBxYv2UXs)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consist of creating a virtual machine on azure which we needed 2 things the resource group which act as a folder in the cloud then next we when and created and storage which where going to put that in the resource group then after that we then creat our vitual machine.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Azure cloud</b>

- <b> Windows server</b>

 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

We open Azure: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next we will create our resource group first:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We creat out resource group then we will clikc on review/create to finalise the process and we make sure the our region matches the one of our storage when we will make one and for the VM to: <br/>

<br />
<br />
we creat the resourses group and aslo the name might be diffrent because i did it previoly in the video walkthorught.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next now we are going to creat a storage so it can into out previosly created reosurces group:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
we just created our storage account which on the resource group we choose the TEST2003 because that was our resource group we connectes both of then together,then for the storage account name we choose any name which is ALIXIA23,aslo for the region is the same as for our resource group,so now we are just going to review/create:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Storage account created and deployed:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now we are going to create the virtual machine:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9tshh4R.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
 Here we are going to select AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nvi48A0.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
  This next step we choose again our same resource group we made in the start then we choose a name for our virtual machine and we use the same region everywhere.On the images part we choose the WINDOWS 10 PRO,VERSION 22H2 - x64 GEN2:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
  Then on this step we need to create and username and a password for our VM machine,then we are going to review and create :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
 Our virtual machine have been created now is time is access it:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
 As shown below is our newly created VM now we need to access that which we are going to need the public ip address and the username we made earlier and the password:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ztQB9bn.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
  Here we are going to used our IP address an the username we created and the password to login to our VM and we are using the remote desktop app to login to our VM:  <br/>

 <br />
<br />
  When done typing your login info this page will pop up here just click yes and you will login:  <br/>

 <br />
<br />
  And there is our VM :  <br/>
